Heart Disease Predictor is a machine learning project, where I tried on predicting potential Heart Diseases in people using Machine Learning algorithms. 

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. 

Then, 4 models were trained and tested with maximum scores as follows:

--K Neighbors Classifier: 87%
--Support Vector Classifier: 83%
--Decision Tree Classifier: 79%
--Random Forest Classifier: 84%

K Neighbors Classifier scored the best score of 87% with 8 neighbors.

The dataset has been taken from Kaggle.
